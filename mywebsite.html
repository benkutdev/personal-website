        <h2>The Team</h2>
        <p>
          This is a team of psychology therapist working voluntarily with the
          support of some friends to help anyone who finds his way on this
          website. The main goal is to break the ice of talking about your
          struggles and insecurities. Once you and one of our team members finds
          out what you feel like and what you might need, we'll start the
          process of finding a therapy place for you. Local or remote, when and
          however you want. This is how it feels.
